# candies
Repository with images of candies in two categories - defective and non-defective.

Peanut balls are one of the many types of products manufactured in the candy industry. They are marketed in coated peanuts in various colors (red, green, blue, brown, orange, yellow, orange and yellow), with ellipsoidal shapes with diameters between 8 and 12 mm.
They present different problems that can arise in the manufacturing, such as cracks and flaking in the cover, irregular shapes, and sizes outside predefined tolerances.
A collection of 200 peanut balls coated with colored candies was considered. Two images per peanut ball were taken in order to build a balanced dataset of 400 images, in such a way that 200 of them belong to the Non-defective class and the remaining 200 belong to the Defective one.
